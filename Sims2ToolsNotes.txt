DBPF Library Serialized Resources
=================================

Process to make a resource class serializable (based on modding STR#)

Pick the class
Find the SimPe/JetBrains source code and make sure Unserialize is complete
Implement public override void Serialize(DbpfWriter writer)
Implement public override uint FileSize
Repeat for each associated class (eg CpfItem for Cpf)

Check every data member is private
Check every data structure is readonly
Check for any existing setters and how they are used (ideally there should be none)

Decide what class data needs setters
Implement setters, setting the _isDirty flag
Override public override bool IsDirty AND public override void SetClean()
Repeat for each associated class (eg CpfItem for Cpf)
